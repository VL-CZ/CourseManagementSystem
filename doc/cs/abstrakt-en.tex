The aim of this thesis is to create a web application for the management of various types of educational courses, such as university lectures, labs, high school subjects or language courses. The app will provide an interface for both administrators - teachers and users - students. 
It will allow the creation and management of courses. Course administrators will be able to change its content (add, remove materials, etc.) and create new assignments that will be later submitted by the students. 
The system will evaluate the questions with choice of answers automatically, the rest will be evaluated manually by the course administrator. 
Users will be able to view all their grades as well as the reviewed assignments.
